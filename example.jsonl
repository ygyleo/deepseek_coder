{"instruction": "Context: The first part is the C/C++ source code, with some lines obscured. The second and third parts are its control-flow graph (CFG) and the compiled assembly. The CFG splits the function into basic blocks, and the provided line numbers are the starting line for each block. Task: 1.Analyze the purpose of each CFG basic block (e.g., condition check, assignment, loop). 2.Cross-reference the corresponding assembly to infer the precise C code logic hidden in each obscured block. 3.Finally, output the previously obscured lines.", "input":"{c code with some lines obscured} {split_lines} {asm code}","output":"{obscured c code}"}
